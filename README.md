# Automatic-Vehical-Number-Plate-Recognition
This is a deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks to recognize vehicle number plates in traffic 

#### Prerequisites
Since will be processing lots of images and videos, a GPU enabled computer is required because it uses a multithreading image processing
